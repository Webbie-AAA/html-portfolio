<h1>The Best Movies According to Umelbnaneen</h1>
<h2>My Favourite Movie Of All Time</h2>
<h3>Bismillah!</h3>
<hr>
<h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>
<p>This is a thriller that will be heralded as a masterpiece to all future generations.
   Incredibly charismatic actors and deep, thought-provoking storyline
</p>

<h3>The Colour Of Paradise</h3>
<p>Serene and morose film. Follows the story of a very pure blind boy and his challenges amongst people against the backdrop
   of his clean heart and sublime nature. Some of the character dialogue left a very deep impression.
   One word to describe this film is 'beautiful'
</p>

<h3>Little Miss Sunshine</h3>
<p>A movie with an interesting message. My favourite element is that this movie is centred around an imperfect family desperate for perfection.
   They go on family trip, the journey full of moments of a. hillarious moments, i.e. classic comedic scenes and
   b. heart-wrenching moments. You come to love the family and the family comes to love each other, and ultimately they discover something much
   more important than their previous desperate pursuits.
